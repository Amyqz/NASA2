##Specify parameters. Units and notation mimic 16cuc; K is 6.24*H*L/d; d0 is where 16cuc has infinite slope; alph=alpha_lambda
eta0=0.00047; eta1=0.011; K=25; alph=.041; X=1.0/5;d0=0.001; L=c(77, 99,125, 175, 195, 240)# central values of fixed parameters. X is new
P0=.1802;P1=.002936; C=5#parameters to be obtained by regression, temporarily fixed by sachs, by guessing, to get examples; 
##P0+P1*L mimics P in 16cuc. C is new, replacing some stuff in 16cuc that involves exp(-H), but in a quite different way.
L=L[4] # a specific example to help guess. The above guesses seem to work pretty well for L[2],L[4], and L[6]
eta=eta0*L*exp(-eta1*L)#just as in 
dE = function(t, E, parms) {# Next line shows the slope as a sum of two terms, NTE+TE. NTE=eta*X*(1-exp(-t/d0))^(X-1)*(exp(-t/d0)/d0)
  list(eta*X*(1-exp(-t/d0))^(X-1)*(exp(-t/d0)/d0)+(K*P0/L+K*P1+alph*(1-P0-P1*L))*(1+C*E))# big advantage to just add slopes
} #something wrong with this line
yini = 0
#need small dose step size near zero where dE varies rapidly; cannot include dose=0 where dE=infinity

outt[170,2]
plot(outt[1:80,])# In the very low dose region NTE effects dominate. dose[80]=8 mGy=.008 Gy
